# Genetic Algorithm Solution For Travelling Salesman Problem

This project makes use of genetic anglorithms to find the shortest path and solve the TSP problem for a list of given city coordinates in 3d.
<br>

TSP is defined as given a list of cities/locations, the person has to go to all the locations exactly once, return back to the starting point, and cover the minimum distance as a whole.

 A location is represented as a combination of 3D coordinate points, x, y, and z. For example: (10, 0, 30) represents a city with x= 10, y = 0, z= 30.

 ## Steps

1. Initial Population
2. Parent Selection: Roulette wheel based
3. Crossover: HGA Based
